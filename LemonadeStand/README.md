This is a simple game that I'm making in Python to expand my knowledge of the language. I am using this to explore basic concepts while building out this game.

You start with $100 and there are different supplies you can buy. Each day requires supplies to make lemonade buit the cost of the supples changes daily.
Each day will have different temprature levels which will affect how many customers arrive at your stand.

Can you make enough money to pay back your loan but also run a profitable business?
